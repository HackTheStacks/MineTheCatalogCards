Prerequisites: For this software to run, you must have tesseract, GNU make, Python, and awk installed. tesseract can be installed on Ubuntu by running `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`. I believe that the others come installed on a base Ubuntu system.

** run make
** filenames at the top of the Makefile
** catalog.tsv - is tsv
** diagnostic - occurrences of various lines
